This is a simple example that shows how easy it is to create a
\LaTeX\ file.
Note that the page is automatically numbered at the bottom. Anything following a percent sign (\%) is ignored up to the end of the line. 
Todayâ€™s date is \today.

It is possible to have notes in the margin\marginpar{like this}.\\ \\
